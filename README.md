   - Provides a dashboard to review, approve, or reject applications  
   - Allows customization of application criteria for each position  

3. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   - Integrates Microsoft Azure Active Directory for secure login and authentication  
   - Role-based access control for students and faculty  

4. **Database Integration**  
   - Supports local PostgreSQL for development environments  
   - Fully compatible with AWS RDS for production-grade database management  

5. **API Integration**  
   - Integrates Microsoft Graph API for accessing user details  

6. **Dockerized Deployment**  
   - Offers a Docker setup for seamless local and production deployments  
   - Simplifies running the application in isolated containers  

7. **AWS EC2 Support**  
   - Optimized for deployment on AWS EC2 instances

# Installation Instructions
To set up this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
- `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sa-connect.git`
- `cd sa-connect`

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (Optional but recommended): If you're using Python 3, create and activate a virtual environment:
- `python -m venv venv`
- `venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install the dependencies:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Set up your .env file:
Create a .env file in the root of the project directory and add the following configurations:

### Microsoft Authentication Configurations
- **AUTHORITY**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>`
- **CLIENT_ID**: `<your-client-id>` 

### Database Connection Configurations
  - AWS EC2 (Production)
    - `AWS_EC2=postgresql+psycopg2://<username>:<password>@<aws-rds-endpoint>/<database-name>`

  - Local Database (Development)
    - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/sa_connect`

### Microsoft Graph API Endpoint
  - `ENDPOINT=https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me`

**Microsoft Authentication Configurations**: These values are necessary for integrating Microsoft Authentication (e.g., login) using Azure AD.
**AWS EC2 Database (Production)**: If deploying on AWS EC2 with AWS RDS, set the `AWS_EC2` value to the connection string for your PostgreSQL RDS instance.
**Local Database (Development)**: If running the app locally, the `DATABASE_URL` will be used to connect to your local PostgreSQL database.
**Microsoft Graph API Endpoint**: The `ENDPOINT` is used for fetching user details from Microsoft Graph API.

### 5. Database Setup:
The application is configured to work with AWS RDS for production environments and SQLite for local development.

- **AWS RDS**:
  - If you plan to deploy the app on AWS EC2 and use AWS RDS, you will need to create an RDS instance (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) and update the `config.py` file with the corresponding RDS connection string.
  - Example configuration for RDS (MySQL):
    - `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<database>'`

- **Local Database**:
  - For local development, the app will connect to a local PostgreSQL database using the `DATABASE_URL` from the `.env` file.

### 6. Docker Setup:
The application can be easily deployed using Docker for both development and production environments.

Steps to run the application using Docker:
1. Build the Docker image: Run the following command to build the Docker image
   - `docker build -t sa_connect .`
2. Run the Docker container: Use the following command to run the application in a Docker container:
   - `docker run -p 5000:5000 sa_connect`

This will start the application inside a Docker container, and you can access it at `http://localhost:5000`.  
**Note**: Make sure that your AWS RDS connection is properly configured when running in Docker for production environments.

### 7. AWS EC2 Deployment:
To deploy the application to AWS EC2:
- Set up an EC2 instance (e.g., Ubuntu-based instance).
- SSH into the EC2 instance and clone the repository:
  - `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sa-connect.git`
- If you're using AWS RDS, make sure to configure the `config.py` file with the appropriate RDS connection string.
- Start the Flask application for production use.

# Running the Application
To start the application locally, run:
- `flask run`

This will start the server on `http://localhost:5000`. You can now access the application in your web browser.
